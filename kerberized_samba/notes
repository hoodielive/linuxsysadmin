=======

The [global] section defines the basic configuration of the Samba server. 
- 3 things should be configured here: 
	1. workgroup -> used to specify the Windows workgroup for the server. 
	2. security -> controls 'how' clients are authenticated by Samba
		security = user [clients log in with a valid username/password managed by the 'local' Samba server]
		* this setting is the default in /etc/samba/smb.conf. 
	3. hosts allow is a comma-, space-, or tab-delimited list of hosts that are permitted to access the Samba service.
		* if not specified, all hosts can access Samba.
		* if it is not specified in the [global] section, it can be set on each share separately.
		* if it specified in the [global] section, then it will apply to all shares, regardless of whether each share 
		  has a different setting. 
		
		Hosts can be specified by host name or by source IP address. 
		Host names are checked by reverse-resolving the IP address of the incoming connection attempt. 
			*see -> hosts_access(5)
		- Allowed hosts can be specified in a number of ways:
		IPv4 network/prefix: 10.0.2.0/24
		IPv4 network/netmask: 10.0.2.0/255.255.255.0
		If the IPv4 subnet prefix is on a byte boundary: 10.0.2.
		IPv6 network/prefix: [2001:db8:0:1::/64] 
		Host name: srv1.rhce.lab
		- All hosts ending in rhce.lab: .rhce.lab 
			- to restrict access to only the hosts from the 10.0.2.0/24 network:
			using the trailing dot notation, the hosts allow etnry in the /etc/samba/smb.conf
			configuration file would read:
				hosts allow - 10.0.
		- To additionally allow access from all host names ending with ".rhce.lab", the '/etc/samba/smb.conf'
		  configuration file entry would be:
		                hosts allow - 10.0. .rhce.lab


[share_name]
path = determines what directory to share. For example:
	path = /sharedpath 
writable = determines should authenticated users have rw access to the share; the default is no. 
	writable = yes 
	if writable = no is set, a comma separated write list of users with rw to the share 'can' be provided.
	Users not on the list will have read-only access.
	Members of local groups can also be specified:
		- write list = @devops will permit all authenticated users who are members of the Linux group 
		"devops" to have write access. 
valid users = if set, specifies a list of users allowed to access the share. Users not on the list are 'not' allowed
	     to access the share. If blank, 'all' users can access the share. 

For example, to allow only user osameji and members of the devops group read-only access to the share myshare, it would
read:
[myshare]
	path = /sharedpath
	writable = no
	valid users = osameji, @devops

[home] defines a special file share, which is enabled by default. 
It makes local home directories available via SMB.

Dilemma
So it seems that I have no qualms with mounting the shares, however, when I try to write to the shares 
there is a permission denied error. This doesn't happen with "smbclient //srv1.rhce.lab/data" -U osa. 
I can write like that, but when I mount to the fs, then there is a permission denied.
