The [global] section defines the basic configuration of the Samba server. 
- 3 things should be configured here: 
	1. workgroup -> used to specify the Windows workgroup for the server. 
	2. security -> controls 'how' clients are authenticated by Samba
		security = user [clients log in with a valid username/password managed by the 'local' Samba server]
		* this setting is the default in /etc/samba/smb.conf. 
	3. hosts allow is a comma-, space-, or tab-delimited list of hosts that are permitted to access the Samba service.
		* if not specified, all hosts can access Samba.
		* if it is not specified in the [global] section, it can be set on each share separately.
		* if it specified in the [global] section, then it will apply to all shares, regardless of whether each share 
		  has a different setting. 
		
		Hosts can be specified by host name or by source IP address. 
		Host names are checked by reverse-resolving the IP address of the incoming connection attempt. 
			*see -> hosts_access(5)
		- Allowed hosts can be specified in a number of ways:
		IPv4 network/prefix: 10.0.2.0/24
		IPv4 network/netmask: 10.0.2.0/255.255.255.0
		If the IPv4 subnet prefix is on a byte boundary: 10.0.2.
		IPv6 network/prefix: [2001:db8:0:1::/64] 
		Host name: srv1.rhce.lab
		- All hosts ending in rhce.lab: .rhce.lab
