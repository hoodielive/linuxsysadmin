Use journalctl to consult system journal 
  - in memory only 

Use systemctl status for an overview of relevant service-related messages 

Use rsyslog for messages written to configuration files 
  - persistent by default


journalctl class:
  - journalctl [will show you all the information that has been logged since reboot]
    - it utilizes the less pager, so you can shift + g (G) to go to the end of the log

  - journalctl -ef [nth and follow (automatically refresh if new logs are writtent to the journal)]

  - journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=sshd.service - show messages restricted or written to the journal by the sshd service

  - journalctl -u sshd.service - similar to previous command; generated by and about sshd 

  - journalctl -p (priorities) emerg..err - show me messages that have a priority between emergency and error 
    (good way to filter out useless information)

  - journalctl -xb - information from last boot (boot information)

  - journalctl [when did your journal begin? How do you filter it by time-range?] 
    - journalctl --since "2018-09-9 17:00:00" --until "2018-09-9 18:00:00"

  - journalctl -o verbose - verbose output 

  How do you make your journals persistent
  vim /etc/systemd/journald.conf 
    uncomment Storage=auto
    mkdir /var/log/journal
    chown root:systemd-journal /var/log/journal 
    chmod 2755 /var/log/journal 
    killall -USR1 systemd-journald
