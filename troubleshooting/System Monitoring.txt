Use Cockpit
yum install cockpit cockpit-system cockpit-storaged cockpit-pcp 
systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket [by default it doesn't come with a service, just a socket]
  - meaning, it will only listen on a port 
  - but get this:
    - firewall-cmd --add-service=cockpit --permanent 
    - firewall-cmd --reload 
    - default port is 9090 

PCP (performance co pilot)
  - yum install pcp pcp-system-tools 
  - systemctl enable --now pmcd 
  - systemctl status pmcd
  - pmstat
  - pmatop
  - install pmlogger [ systemctl status pmlogger ]
  - cd /var/log/pcp/pmlogger && ls 
    cd ts.rhce.lab 
    du -hs .
  - pminfo 
  - pminfo | wc 
  - pmval -s 5 proc.nprocs (look at the number of procs)
    get info on specific values | track pcp metric and monitor 
  - pmval -T lminute kernel.percpu.cpu.idle 
    shows idle statistics 
  - pmval -a /var/log/pcp/pmlogger/ts.rhce.lab/20180424.18.44.0 kernel.all.load  -S  '@Tue Sep 03 18:45 5:00' -T 
  - yum search pcp (rich documentation but I'm tired of reading it - extremely terse)
    yum install pcp-doc
  - man pcpintro

Understanding Logging: 

rsyslog: 
- facility 
- priority
- destination 

Which facility will it look at?
Which priority will it consider? 
Where is it logged at in /var/log? 

- does not log everything, only what the admin permits 
- supports remote logging: configure a logging server 

systemd-journald:
- logs everything that is managed by systemd 
- runtime only (in-memory)
- can be integrated with rsyslog (and will apply its filtering mechanism)


Lab: 
Configure a remote logging server 
Make the server listen 

/var/log/rsyslog.conf :: uncomment udp 
on client uncomment @@remote-host:514 (but *.* logs everything so make sure you know what you're getting into)
@@ means udp 
 - ss -tuna 
 port 515 
 firewall-cmd --add-port=515/tcp --permanent 

 logger "Hello, from the ts server"
