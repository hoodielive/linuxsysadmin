Lab:
Symptom -> Anonymous users can download files but cannot upload files 

Install:
  -> lftp 

$ lftp 
  lftp localhost:~> ls
   `ls' at 0 [Delaying before reconnect: 44]

Define (Getter):
  Is the server running? 
   - systemctl status vsftpd 
  
  now 
  lftp> 
   put file
   put: Access failed: 553 Could not create file. (file)

   Anonymous user can't upload files [defined]

   vim /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf 

   anonymous_enable ?
   anon_upload_enable ?
   anon_mkdir_write_enable ? 
   grep ftp /etc/passwd 
   getent passwd ftp (this will also show the document root which by default is /var/ftp)
   cd /var/ftp: is there a pub directory? What are the perms? 
   mkdir uploads && chmod 0777 uploads 
   systemctl restart vsftpd

   lftp
   cd uploads 
   put /etc/hosts 
   Permission still denied ? 
   Is it a connectivity issue? No, it's localhost; if networked then test through adjacent servers; what is the 
    fqdn? firewall? selinux? 

  Selinux? 

  getenforce? 

  setenforce? permissive and test! 
  
  getsebool -a | grep ftp 

  setsebool -P is there are booleans that need to be set

  grep sealert /var/log/messages 
    - is there an alert indicating SELinux is preventing vsftpd from append access on file /uploads/hosts ? 
    - read those alerts solutions (but sometimes they are stupid or don't make sense)
    set selinux fcontext to public_content_rw_t

    semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_rw_t "/var/log/uploads(/.*)?"
    /sbin/restorecon -Rv /var/log/uploads 

    Make sure booleans are set as well! 

  setenforce back to Enforcing 
    setenforce 1
