Troubleshooting Methodology 

- define the issue (a problem well defined is a problem half-solved)
- gather information 
- form a hypothesis 
- test the hypothesis 
- fix the problem


Defining Issues: 
For example: 

If you cannot connect to a ftp server, you don't say something is wrong with the ftp server, rather you should
say, I cannot connect to an ftp server, from my machine. 

- Provide details because the issue by itself doesn't say anything. 
  - it may be a symptom of another problem 


Gathering information:
Look at the log files:
  - journalctl 
  - systemctl status -l 

- Don't go to far in getting information lol 

Form a Hypothesis:
- may mean nothing, but you'll know when you test your hypothesis 

Test the hypothesis:
- Validation 

Fix the problem:
- If problem is not fixed, then you'll start this process over because this means that your hypothesis is wrong! 
- Builds experiences (be thankful for errors)
