Define: 

User can't log in [permission denied]

Gather information:

systemctl status sshd 
tail /var/log/secure 
look for password related errors 
getent passwd user => do you see /bin/false or nologin syntax ? 

Hypotheses will be formed from info-gathering session and testing thereby 

Solve issue:
If it is a password issue, have user to change password
If it is an login issue where the user is denied login /bin/false, then grant access, etc.,
