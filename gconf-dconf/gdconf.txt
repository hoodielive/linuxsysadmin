Dconf is a settings database used in Gnome3 and similar systems (such as Unity and XFCE). 

Dconf is the predecessor to Gconf which was used in Gnome2. 

Dconf acts like the registry used on Windows systems. 

Understanding this system may help users figure out how to make various changes and fixes to their system.

Dconf provides a Windows-registry-like interface. ~/.config/dconf/user is the binary database used by Dconf.

GSettings is a binary interface to the same data seen in Dconf. 

The "gsettings" command-line utility provides a way to modify data in the Dconf database. 

In a terminal, executing “gsettings list-schemas” will print a list of schemas while “gsettings list-keys SCHEMA.SUB” 

will print the keys within a schema. 

To set/change a key's value, type “gsettings set SCHEMA KEY VALUE”.

Gconf is the now obsolete and was used in Gnome2. 

It used an XML database. 

Even though this system is old, some programs still use it (as seen by the ~/.gconf/ directory).

Dconf-editor is a GUI program used to make various edits/changes to the Dconf database. 

On the left side of the window are various categories such as apps, ca, com, desktop, org, and system. 

Each one stores many sub-categories. 

The right side of the window displays the settings for the selected category or sub-category. 

In this part of the window, users can make changes to the settings. 

At the bottom of the window, users will see various information about the selected setting.
