Error: mount.nfs4: operation not permitted

- check that ntpd is synced 
server idm.rhce.lab 
peer srv1.rhce.lab

Error: permission denied 
- check nfs-secure-server is enabled and started (assume nothing) 

- Study every part of NFS.

# Resolution (finally solved this thing) 
mount.nfs4 and mount.nfs are symlinked 
- make sure nfs-secure is running on client and nfs-secure-server is running on server
- make sure krb5.conf file is populated with the the kerberos realm and kdc server information - because authconfig 
  does 'NOT' populate these fields. 
- the proper syntax for mounting from client is:
	mount.nfs -o sec=krb5p srv1:/nfssecure /srv/secure -vvv
- For verbose logging on the server side:
	- set rpcsvcgssd to '-vvv' in the '/etc/sysconfig/nfs' file. 
- For verbose logging on the client side:
	- set rpcgssd to '-vvv' in the '/etc/sysconfig/nfs' file. 
- Parse logs with journalctl:
	- journalctl -xe and/or -u nfs-secure (client) or nfs-secure-server (server) 


Another thing - jus mount this thing as nfs version 3 in the /etc/fstab as it apparently chokes on nfs4 configuration.
