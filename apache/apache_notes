Apache Notes 

Download the Apache Web Server RPM 
  - sudo yumdownloader httpd 

Query the package 
  - rpm -qpi httpd-*rpm 

Query the config files 
  - rpm -qpc httpd-*rpm 

Command Line Options 
  - nvim /etc/sysconfig/httpd 

Apache Log rotatation 
  - /etc/logrotate.d/httpd

Apache temporary runtime files (no need to change this file) 
  - /etc/tmpfiles.d/httpd.conf

Error Messages a user sees if there is an issue
  - /var/www/error

Ancilliary configurations 
  - /etc/httpd/conf.d 
  - any file in this directory that ends with '.conf' will be pulled into the main 'httpd.conf' file and used to configure Apache
  - new modules usually store their configs in this directory :: mod_ssl (secure web servers) and mod_python (interprets python code)
    ssl.conf :: python.conf, respectively 

## Install ## 
RHEL -> yum groupinstall "Web Server" or yum install httpd 


- Why is it that when vhosts are active, the private directory configuration doesn't work? I have disabled vhosts and put the 
<Directory /var/www/html/private> 
  AuthType Basic 
  AuthName "This is a private directory."
  AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/conf/htpass
  Require valid-user 
</Directory> 

configuration into the httpd.conf file and then it works. 

*(vhost1 is listening on 8888)
*(vhost2 is listening on 80)

What then is the problem?
